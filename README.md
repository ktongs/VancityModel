# VancityModel
Given a sample financial dataset of Vancity customer, predict the likelihood of a customer to sign up for a RRSP account.

## Description
The origin of the data was from my friends class assignment where they had to create a prediction model and present a lift chart that shows the increased value from the model.
I wanted to try working with real data for the first time and create a predictive model myself.
The bulk of the project was in data wrangling and engineering. Once that was completed, it was tested on various Machine Learning models such as linear regression and random forest. This was iterated over many times.
I also used this dataset to build my own multi-layer neural network to understand the Tensorflow framework and the process of training a model.
